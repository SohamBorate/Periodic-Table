# Periodic Table
Computer program to help me memorize the periodic table.

Written on a random Sunday.

Elements and shortcuts are from Group 1 to Group 18.

Lanthanoid and Actinoid series are not there, memorize it the old-fashioned, less cooler way ;)

## Usage
Practice elements from shortcuts
```
>>> periodic_table elements
```

Practice shortcuts from elements
```
>>> periodic_table shortcuts
```

Practice elements from shortcuts (randomised)
```
>>> periodic_table elements hard
```

Practice shortcuts from elements (randomised)
```
>>> periodic_table shortcuts hard
```

Maybe I'll add more later on, like answer the group and period of a specific element.
