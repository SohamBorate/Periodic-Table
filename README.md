# Periodic Table
Computer program to help me memorize the periodic table.

Written on a random Sunday.

Elements and tricks are from Group 1 to Group 18.

Lanthanoid and Actinoid series are not there, memorize it the old-fashioned, less cooler way ;)

## Usage
- Practice elements for each group
```
>>> periodic_table groups elements
```

- Practice tricks for each group
```
>>> periodic_table groups tricks
```

- Practice elements by tricks as hints
```
>>> periodic_table elements tricks
```

- Practice tricks by elements as hints
```
>>> periodic_table tricks elements
```

- Add `hard` at the end to randomise the order, for example:
```
>>> periodic_table groups tricks hard
```

***

Maybe I'll add more later on, like answer the group and period of a specific element.
